                        <p>We start this business as a small retail shop on 1st January 2022. We started by selling a few compatible brands of toner cartridges for the different types and brands of printers and photocopiers. We then added the printers themselves to our stock and later we engaged in both Original and compatible brands of toner cartridges. We started with two employees including my self, then we we added two more as the business grew. We have since cherished the duty of serving the community and helping people meet their goals through reliable service delivery. We do deal in all brands, we just singled out HP but we also have Dell, Kyocera, Samsung, Canon, Xerox and many others. We serve you the best according to your budget.</p>
